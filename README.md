# rPlaceGame
## Synopsis

The game largely resembles the famous r/Place project which was released on Reddit as an intriguing project that required teamwork and strategy.
In our version, the focus of the game is to allow players to communicate and think creatively with a large team to develop a game plan to
conquer the map. Once players join the webpage, they will sign in immediately and be randomly assigned to a team. Once players are settled
into teams, they will each be given an option to place an object - which can be a soldier or a wall. A timer will begin once the moves have been
played and will repeat until one's next turn. The game will officially end after a team conquers the entire map or after a
determined amount of time.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

This project exists as a continuation of the r/Place game and as a way for fans of the game or anyone to spend time on a game which will
test their creativity as well as their algorithmic thinking skills. With collaborative efforts, our team proceeded to expand our knowledge
on backend and frontend work by utilizing languages such as Javascript, HTML/CSS, and other extensions as well as database software like 
MongoDB to come up with this product. 

## Game Specifics

Possible Actions Include:
- Only placing Objects in one's own territory (border-inclusive)
- Wall
   - When walls are placed together, it is harder for enemy to advance lines
   - More health than a soldier (3 HP)
- Soldier
   - Each soldier has 1 HP
   - More likely to be killed if soldier is by itself
   - In each turn, a player can decide which direction a soldier should move to
